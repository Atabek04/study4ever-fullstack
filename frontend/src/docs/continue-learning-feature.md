# Continue Learning Feature Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the "Continue Learning" feature that allows users to automatically navigate to the next lesson when clicking the "Continue Course" button on course cards.

## Features Implemented

1. **Backend API Endpoint**
   - Created a new endpoint: `/api/v1/courses/{courseId}/continue-learning` in `CourseProgressController`
   - Returns the next lesson details as a `NextLessonDto` object with module and lesson information

2. **Frontend Integration**
   - Created a new custom hook `useContinueLearning` that fetches the next lesson to continue with
   - Updated the CourseCard component to use the new endpoint for the "Continue Learning" button
   - Added loading and error states for better user experience

3. **Progress Tracking**
   - Added a notification system for course progress updates
   - Integrated the lesson completion system with this notification system
   - Improved caching and localStorage management for better performance

## How It Works

The feature works as follows:

1. When a user opens the course dashboard, the CourseCard will call the `useContinueLearning` hook
2. The hook calls the backend endpoint to get the next lesson the user should continue with
3. The CourseCard displays a "Continue Learning" button that takes the user to that lesson
4. When the user completes a lesson, the system notifies all components that the progress has changed
5. The hook automatically refreshes its data so the next time the user clicks "Continue Learning", they get the updated next lesson

## Testing Instructions

To test this feature:

1. Log in to the application
2. Go to the dashboard page where course cards are displayed
3. Click on the "Continue Learning" button on any course card
4. Verify that you're taken to the correct lesson (the next uncompleted lesson)
5. Complete that lesson by clicking the checkbox icon
6. Return to the dashboard
7. Click the "Continue Learning" button again
8. Verify that you're now taken to the next lesson in sequence

If you complete all lessons in the course, the "Continue Learning" button should take you to the last lesson of the course.

## Technical Details

- The backend uses a new DTO class `NextLessonDto` to represent the next lesson data
- The system leverages the course structure and completed lessons to find the next lesson
- The frontend uses a combination of API calls and localStorage for optimal performance
- Progress updates are communicated via a custom event system and the Context API
- Proper error handling has been implemented for both frontend and backend
